MSync
=====

Sync your Ctools resources to your local drive without tedious clicks!

Current version is working under ubuntu 12.04-LTE. You are welcome to try it out in different OS, but it is unlikely to be working under Windows.

##Installation

The GUI is based on PHP-GTK. So to get it working, you need to install PHP-GTK first. (FYI: It's not a easy thing to install PHP-GTK).

For ubuntu user, you can follow this link to install PHP-GTK.
[Install php-gtk under ubuntu 12.04](http://forums.eukhost.com/f15/how-install-php-gtk-ubuntu-12-04-debian-17378/#.UF0417Qge6w)

After installation of PHP-GTK, download sources to any folder you like.

##Get it running

Simply run:

    php gui.php

You can also make a shell script to run it without using command line.

Besides that, if you feel uncomfortable with PHP-GTK, you can look into utility.php and create your script version.

##Further work

Since it's hard to get PHP-GTK working, if I have spare time, I would like to migrate the code to Java. Let me know if you are insterested!.
